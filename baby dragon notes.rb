#baby dragon notes.

#we create the dragon.

#feeding, tossing, rocking, and changing the dragon passes time.


#passing time does this
  #subtract number from tummy
  #add number to guts
  #subtract energy.
  #alert user if hungry
  #alert user if needs diaper change
  #alerts user if tired.
  
  #if  hungry, poopy, or tired numbers get too low, something happens.
